### About

This is a program that can summarize any texts you can screenshot using Microsoft's Snipping Tool with the help of Google's Gemini. I made this cos i was bored lol also dont mind the long name, i suck at naming things. Should've probably consulted with an AI chatbot for a name in hindsight smh
